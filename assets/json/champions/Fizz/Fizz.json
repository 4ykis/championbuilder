{"id":105,"key":"Fizz","name":"Fizz","title":"the Tidal Trickster","lore":"Centuries ago, an ancient water-dwelling race built a hidden city beneath a mountain in the sea. Though these creatures had their enemies, the city was an impenetrable fortress, and, in the safety it provided, they grew complacent. Fizz, however, harbored a curious spirit that could not be satisfied living so cushioned a life. Unable to resist the allure of danger, Fizz had a habit of sneaking out of the city to look for trouble. In his many adventures he grew to be a powerful fighter with a keen resourcefulness that let him skirt danger with clever ease. One day, Fizz returned to find the city abandoned: his people had vanished, leaving Fizz without a clue to explain their disappearance. With nothing left in the city to keep him, Fizz salvaged an enchanted trident from the ruins and set out alone.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFor years, Fizz wandered the ocean, using the skills he'd learned during his adventures as a young boy to survive. Finally, Fizz discovered the port of Bilgewater. He was fascinated with the existence of life above the water and could not resist exploring the island. In his endless curiosity, Fizz inadverently meddled in the affairs of the humans who lived there and his presence did not go unnoticed. His mischief angered many residents who eventually sought to capture or kill him. Fizz found himself cornered, and he prepared to return to the sea despite the fondness he'd come to hold for Bilgewater. As he stood at the docks, a massive dragon-shark attacked the port. Fizz defeated the beast, using his resourcefulness and knowledge of the creatures' weaknesses to his advantage. Having earned the gratitude and respect of the humans, Fizz decided to stay in Bilgewater. He joined the League of Legends to further serve his new home.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E''Fizz makes even the saltiest sailors of Bilgewater look like drunken landlubbers in a fight. Good thing he's on our side.''\u003Cbr\u003E-- Miss Fortune, the Bounty Hunter","skins":[{"id":105000,"name":"default","num":0},{"id":105001,"name":"Atlantean Fizz","num":1},{"id":105002,"name":"Tundra Fizz","num":2},{"id":105003,"name":"Fisherman Fizz","num":3},{"id":105004,"name":"Void Fizz","num":4},{"id":105008,"name":"Cottontail Fizz","num":8},{"id":105009,"name":"Super Galaxy Fizz","num":9}],"allytips":["Since Fizz can move through units, find opportunities in lane to walk through minions and apply Seastone Trident's passive - following it up with the ability's active attack after a few seconds.","Fizz's ultimate ability, Chum the Waters, can be aimed at an enemy or towards the area where you think they'll be going.","Fizz's spells scale off Ability Power - consider getting items like Zhonya's Hourglass or Abyssal Scepter against teams that have high burst threat - and items like Lich Bane or Rabadon's Deathcap if you think you can survive without the Health."],"enemytips":["Fizz becomes extremely deadly if his damage over time ability ticks on you for a few seconds - keep him away until it falls off!","Fizz is a slippery target when his abilities are not on cooldown - bait him into using them early and follow up with crowd control or hard-hitting attacks!"],"tags":["Assassin","Fighter"],"info":{"attack":6,"defense":4,"magic":7,"difficulty":6},"stats":{"arm":22.412,"ad":58.04,"aso":-0.05,"crit":0,"hp":558.48,"mp":317.2,"mp5":6,"hp5":8.176,"range":175,"ms":335,"mr":32.1,"lvl":{"arm":3.4,"ad":3,"aso":3.1,"crit":0,"hp":86,"mp":37,"mp5":0.8,"hp5":0.7,"mr":1.25}},"pass":{"name":"Nimble Fighter","descr":"Fizz's dexterity allows him to move through units and take less physical damage from basic attacks.","img":"Fizz_P.png"},"spells":[{"name":"Urchin Strike","descr":"Fizz dashes through his target, dealing magic damage and applying on hit effects.","tooltip":"Fizz dashes through his target, dealing \u003Cspan class=\"colorFF8C00\"\u003E{{ a2 }}\u003C\/span\u003E physical damage plus {{ e1 }} \u003Cspan class=\"color99FF99\"\u003E(+{{ a1 }})\u003C\/span\u003E magic damage.
