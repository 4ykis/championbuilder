Too quick. No fight. More. I want... more.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EA voice? Unfamiliar. I see him. The Grand General. My general.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHe leads. I follow. Marching. To where? I should know. I can't remember.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIt all bleeds together. Does it matter? Noxus conquers. The rest? Trivial. So long...  since I've tasted victory.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe war wagon rocks. Rattles. A cramped cage. Pointless ceremony. The waiting. Maddening. Faster, dogs!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThere. Banners. Demacians and their walls. Cowards. Their gates will shatter. Thoughts of the massacre come easily.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWho gave the order to halt? The underlings don't answer. No familiar faces. If I do not remember, neither will history.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe cage is opened. Finally! No more waiting. WE CHARGE!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESlings and arrows? The weapons of children! Their walls will not save them!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EI can taste their fear. They shrink at every blow as their barricades splinter. SOON!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ENoxian drums. Demacian screams. Glory isn't accolades; glory is hot blood on your hands! This is life!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EA thousand shattered corpses lie at my feet, and Demacian homes burn all around me. It's over too quickly! Just one more...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe men stare. There's fear in their eyes. If they're afraid to look upon victory, I should pluck those craven eyes out. There is no fear in the Grand General's eyes, only approval. He is pleased with this conquest.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWalking the field with the Grand General, surveying the carnage, I ache for another foe. He is hobbled, a leg wound from the battle? If it pains him, he does not show it. A true Noxian. I do not like his pet, though; it picks over the dead, having earned nothing. His war hounds were more fitting company.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EDemacia will be within our grasp soon. I can feel it. I am ready to march. The Grand General insists that I rest. How can I rest when my enemies still live?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhy do we mill about? The waiting eats at me. I'm left to my own devices. The bird watches. It's unsettling. Were it anyone else's, I would crush it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFatigue sets in. I've never felt so... tired.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBoram? Is that you? What are you whispering?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhere am I?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ECaptured? Kenneled like some dog. How?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThere was... the battle, the razing of the fortress, the quiet of the aftermath. Were we ambushed? I can't remember.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EI was wounded. I can feel the ragged gash... but no pain. They thought me dead. Now, I am their prize. Fate is laughing. I will not be caged! They will regret sparing me.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EDemacian worms! They parrot kind words, but they are ruthless all the same. This place is a dank pit. They bring no food. There is no torture. They do not make a show of me. I am left to rot.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EI remember my finest hour. I held a king by his throat and felt the final beat of his heart through my tightening grasp. I don't remember letting go. Is this your vengeance, Jarvan?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EI hear the triumphal march. Boots on stone. Faint, through the dungeon walls. The cadence of Noxian drums. I shall be free. Demacian blood will run in the streets!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ENo one came. I heard no struggle. No retreat. Did I imagine it?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThere is no aching in this stump. I barely noticed the iron boot. It's caked in rust.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhen did I lose my leg?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EI still smell the blood. Battle. It brings comfort.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe hunger gnaws. I have not slept. Time crawls. So tired.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHow long?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESo dark. This pit. I remember.
