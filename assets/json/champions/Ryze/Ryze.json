Armed with a boundless constitution and a vast array of mystic knowledge, he spends his life searching for World Runes - fragments of the raw magic that once shaped the world from nothingness. He must retrieve these glyphs before they fall into the wrong hands, for though they were once used to create Runeterra, they also have the potential to destroy it.","skins":[{"id":13000,"name":"default","num":0},{"id":13001,"name":"Young Ryze","num":1},{"id":13002,"name":"Tribal Ryze","num":2},{"id":13003,"name":"Uncle Ryze","num":3},{"id":13004,"name":"Triumphant Ryze","num":4},{"id":13005,"name":"Professor Ryze","num":5},{"id":13006,"name":"Zombie Ryze","num":6},{"id":13007,"name":"Dark Crystal Ryze","num":7},{"id":13008,"name":"Pirate Ryze","num":8},{"id":13009,"name":"Ryze Whitebeard","num":9},{"id":13010,"name":"SKT T1 Ryze","num":10}],"allytips":["Use Overload's passive to optimize for maximum damage or maximum survivability.","Spell Flux's short cooldown allows it to be used to spread Flux to many enemies.","Ryze can move and cast other spells while Realm Warp is charging without cancelling the portal."],"enemytips":["Ryze is especially dangerous to opponents that are marked with Flux.","Use Realm Warp's windup time to figure out how to deal with what may be coming out of the portal.","Crowd controlling Ryze during Realm Warp's windup will cancel the portal."],"tags":["Mage","Fighter"],"info":{"attack":2,"defense":2,"magic":10,"difficulty":7},"stats":{"arm":21.552,"ad":55.04,"aso":0,"crit":0,"hp":558.48,"mp":400,"mp5":6,"hp5":7,"range":550,"ms":340,"mr":30,"lvl":{"arm":3,"ad":3,"aso":2.112,"crit":0,"hp":86,"mp":50,"mp5":0.8,"hp5":0.55,"mr":0}},"pass":{"name":"Arcane Mastery","descr":"\u003CmainText\u003ERyze's spells deal extra damage based on his Bonus Mana, and he gains a percentage increase to his maximum Mana based on his Ability Power.\u003C\/mainText\u003E","img":"Ryze_P.png"},"spells":[{"name":"Overload","descr":"Passively, Ryze's other damaging spells reset Overload and begin to charge a Rune that can be used to empower Overload.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOn cast, Ryze throws a charge of pure energy in a line, dealing damage to the first enemy struck.
