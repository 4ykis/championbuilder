Once, he was his empire's most esteemed warrior, leading the armies of Shurima to countless victories. However, after the empire's fall, Renekton was entombed beneath the sands, and slowly, as the world turned and changed, he succumbed to insanity. Now free once more, he is utterly consumed with finding and killing his brother, Nasus, who he blames, in his madness, for the centuries he spent in darkness.","skins":[{"id":58000,"name":"default","num":0},{"id":58001,"name":"Galactic Renekton","num":1},{"id":58002,"name":"Outback Renekton","num":2},{"id":58003,"name":"Bloodfury Renekton","num":3},{"id":58004,"name":"Rune Wars Renekton","num":4},{"id":58005,"name":"Scorched Earth Renekton","num":5},{"id":58006,"name":"Pool Party Renekton","num":6},{"id":58007,"name":"Prehistoric Renekton","num":7},{"id":58008,"name":"SKT T1 Renekton","num":8}],"allytips":["Slice and Dice excels at harassing maneuvers.
